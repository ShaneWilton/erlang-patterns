<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/gar1t/erlang-patterns">https://github.com/gar1t/erlang-patterns</a></strong></p>

<p>This contribution policy has been adapted from
<a href="http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22">C4.1 - Collective Code Construction Contract</a>
to meet the needs of this project. It is subject to change and
suggested improvements are welcome.</p>

<h2 id="language">Language</h2>

<p>The key words &#8220;MUST&#8221;, &#8220;MUST NOT&#8221;, &#8220;REQUIRED&#8221;, &#8220;SHALL&#8221;, &#8220;SHALL NOT&#8221;,
&#8220;SHOULD&#8221;, &#8220;SHOULD NOT&#8221;, &#8220;RECOMMENDED&#8221;, &#8220;MAY&#8221;, and &#8220;OPTIONAL&#8221; in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>To maximize the scale of the community around the project by
 reducing the friction for new Contributors</p></li>
<li><p>To relieve dependencies on key individuals by separating different
 skill sets so that there is a larger pool of competence in any
 required domain</p></li>
<li><p>To support diversity of the contributions to the project</p></li>
<li><p>To enforce collective ownership of the project</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<h3 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The project SHALL use the git distributed revision control system.</p></li>
<li><p>The project SHALL be hosted on github.com or equivalent, herein
 called the &#8220;Platform&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p>The project SHALL use the Platform issue tracker.</p></li>
<li><p>A &#8220;Maintainer&#8221; is a person who merges patches to the
 project. Maintainers are not developers - their job is to enforce
 process.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintainers SHALL have commit access to the repository.</p></li>
<li><p>A &#8220;Contributor&#8221; is a person who wishes to provide a patch, being a
 set of commits that solve some clearly identified problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Contributors SHALL NOT have commit access to the repository unless
 they are also Maintainers.</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone without distinction or discrimination SHALL have an equal
 right to become a Contributor under the terms of this contract.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="licensingandownership">Licensing and Ownership</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The project SHALL use the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
 International license.</p></li>
<li><p>All contributions to the project source code (&#8220;patches&#8221;) SHALL use
 the same license as the project.</p></li>
<li><p>All patches are owned by their authors. There SHALL NOT be any
 copyright assignment process.</p></li>
<li><p>The copyrights in the project SHALL be owned collectively by all its
 Contributors.</p></li>
<li><p>Each Contributor SHALL be responsible for identifying themselves in
 the project Contributor list.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="patchrequirements">Patch Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Maintainers and Contributors MUST have a Platform account and SHOULD
 use their real names or a well-known alias.</p></li>
<li><p>A patch SHOULD be a minimal and accurate answer to exactly one
 identified and agreed upon problem.</p></li>
<li><p>A patch MUST adhere to the project Methodology (see METHODOLOGY.md).</p></li>
<li><p>A patch SHALL NOT include non-trivial code from other projects
 unless the Contributor is the original author of that code.</p></li>
<li><p>A patch commit message SHOULD consist of a single short (less than
 50 character) line summarizing the change, optionally followed by a
 blank line and then a more thorough description.</p></li>
<li><p>A &#8220;Correct Patch&#8221; is one that satisfies the above requirements.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="developmentprocess">Development Process</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Change on the project SHALL be governed by the pattern of accurately
 identifying problems and applying minimal, sufficient solutions to
 these problems.</p></li>
<li><p>To request changes, a user SHOULD log an issue on the project
 Platform issue tracker.</p></li>
<li><p>The user or Contributor SHOULD write the issue by describing the
 problem they face or observe.</p></li>
<li><p>The user or Contributor SHOULD seek consensus on the accuracy of
 their observation, and the value of solving the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus, the release history of the project SHALL be a list of
 meaningful issues logged and solved.</p></li>
<li><p>To work on an issue, a Contributor SHALL fork the project repository
 and then work on their forked repository.</p></li>
<li><p>To submit a patch, a Contributor SHALL create a Platform pull
 request back to the project.</p></li>
<li><p>A Contributor SHALL NOT commit changes directly to the project.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Platform implements pull requests as issues, a Contributor
 MAY directly send a pull request without logging a separate issue.</p></li>
<li><p>To discuss a patch, people MAY comment on the Platform pull request,
 on the commit, or elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>To accept or reject a patch, a Maintainer SHALL use the Platform
 interface.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintainers SHOULD NOT merge their own patches except in exceptional
 cases, such as non-responsiveness from other Maintainers for an
 extended period (more than 1&#8211;2 days).</p></li>
<li><p>Maintainers SHALL NOT make value judgments on correct patches.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintainers SHALL merge correct patches from other Contributors
 rapidly.</p></li>
<li><p>The Contributor MAY tag an issue as &#8220;Ready&#8221; after making a pull
 request for the issue.</p></li>
<li><p>The user who created an issue SHOULD close the issue after checking
 the patch is successful.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintainers SHOULD ask for improvements to incorrect patches and
 SHOULD reject incorrect patches if the Contributor does not respond
 constructively.</p></li>
<li><p>Any Contributor who has value judgments on a correct patch SHOULD
 express these via their own patches.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintainers MAY commit changes to non-source documentation directly
 to the project.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="projectadministration">Project Administration</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The project founders SHALL act as Administrators to manage the set
 of project Maintainers.</p></li>
<li><p>The Administrators SHALL ensure their own succession over time by
 promoting the most effective Maintainers.</p></li>
<li><p>A new Contributor who makes a correct patch SHALL be invited to
 become a Maintainer.</p></li>
<li><p>Administrators MAY remove Maintainers who are inactive for an
 extended period of time, or who repeatedly fail to apply this
 process accurately.</p></li>
<li><p>Administrators SHOULD block or ban &#8220;bad actors&#8221; who cause stress and
 pain to others in the project. This should be done after public
 discussion, with a chance for all parties to speak. A bad actor is
 someone who repeatedly ignores the rules and culture of the project,
 who is needlessly argumentative or hostile, or who is offensive, and
 who is unable to self-correct their behavior when asked to do so by
 others.</p></li>
