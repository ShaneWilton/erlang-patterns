Erlang Patterns is an experimental project to apply
[Christopher Alexander's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander)
pattern language method, as outlined in
[The Timeless Way of Building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building),
to Erlang programming. Unlike traditional
[software design pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)
efforts, which tend to emphasize the importance of code reuse, this
project emphasizes patterns that *feel good to humans*. For more
information, see the project [Methodology](methodology.html).
